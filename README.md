# Project Overview
 - In this lab, first we created a repository and invited our partner to it. Then we cloned the repository using VSC. For excercise B we had to write css code in the responsive.html file that changes the size and look of the website layout based on the width of the screen that the website is on. We added css that screen sizes that would suit desktops, tablets, and mobiles. We had to do this without using flex in our code. For excercise C we had to do the same proccess as C, but use flex as a part of your code.
